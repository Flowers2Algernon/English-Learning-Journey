# Why you need begin through Listening?

Now, think back to your childhood, how did you learn to speak? Parents and other people would say words or sentences that you could understand, and you would repeat them. For instance, when you were hungry but didn’t know how to express it, your mother would teach you how to say it. Then, every time you felt hungry, you could say this word or a simple sentence related to hunger to your mom, and she would understand what you meant.

The above situation is related to a term - ‘valid input’.

So, why is valid input important first?

Watch the following YouTube video, and you might understand it better.

###### So, here is the question, what method or material you should use?

Self-Assessment Before we dive into the intermediate level, let’s start with a few self-assessment questions to see if this level is suitable for you:

- Do you currently only remember the letters A, B, and C? Are basic grammar concepts like singular/plural and tenses completely unfamiliar to you?

- Have you never developed the habit of imitating and shadowing native speakers? Have you never consistently practiced this for more than three days?

- Have you never had the habit of regularly listening to English (excluding listening exercises for exams or watching TV shows with Chinese or English subtitles)?

- Has it been more than three years since you last studied English?

- Do you feel that your vocabulary is below 3000 words ?

   If you answered “yes” to more than three of the above questions, then the materials and methods mentioned in this section are not suitable for you. Please find a basic course and keep learning. The strategies and methods mentioned below are not suitable for you; attempting them may either be too challenging or lead to mental exhaustion and disharmony in your life. After completing the self-assessment, let’s move on to formal learning.
